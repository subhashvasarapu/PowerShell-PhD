📖 Introduction to KQL
Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a read-only query language designed for big data analytics. Used primarily in Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights, it is optimized for interactive ad hoc queries.

Developed by Microsoft for Azure Data Explorer.
Declarative and SQL-like but tailored for telemetry data.
Use-cases: performance monitoring, diagnostics, security analysis.
🧠 Core Concepts
Everything is table-based.
Queries are pipeline-based, flowing through | operators.
Supports structured, semi-structured, and time-series data.
Read-only: No data updates via KQL.
🧾 Basic Syntax
TableName
| where Condition
| summarize Count = count() by Column
| order by Count desc
Case-sensitive.
Whitespace and indentation improve readability but are not required.
⚙️ Query Operators
project, extend, summarize, where, order by, take, join
Control flow: if, case
Type casting: tostring(), toint(), etc.
🔠 Data Types
Primitive: string, int, long, datetime, bool, real, guid
Complex: dynamic (JSON-like), timespan
📥 Data Ingestion and Schema
In Azure, data is pushed into tables like Perf, Heartbeat, SecurityEvent, etc.
Schema = columns + data types + metadata
Use .show and .ingest commands (in ADX context).

📊 Commonly Used Tables (Azure)
AzureActivity, SigninLogs, SecurityEvent
Perf, Syslog, Heartbeat, AppRequests
Usage, InsightsMetrics
🔍 Filtering, Sorting, Projection
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Account
| order by TimeGenerated desc
📈 Aggregation & Summarization
SigninLogs
| summarize Failures = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), ResultType
count(), avg(), max(), sum(), percentiles(), make_list()
🔗 Joins and Lookups
Table1
| join kind=inner (Table2) on CommonColumn
inner, leftouter, rightouter, fullouter, anti, semi
🔄 Subqueries and Let Statements
let FailedLogins = SigninLogs | where ResultType != 0;
FailedLogins | summarize count() by UserPrincipalName
Use let for modular, reusable logic.
⏱️ Time Series Analysis
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
Use make-series, range, bin(), and serialize
📊 Rendering & Visualization
Perf
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| render timechart
Types: timechart, barchart, piechart, table
🧮 Advanced Functions & Plugins
Math/Stats: percentile(), variance(), stdev()
String: split(), substring(), replace_string()
Datetime: ago(), now(), startofhour()
Dynamic: parse_json(), extractjson()
Plugins: predict, anomaly_detection, cluster()
🔐 Security and Access Control
RBAC at Azure Resource and Log Analytics Workspace level.
Table-level permissions.
KQL itself doesn’t write data, ensuring read-only integrity.
🚀 Performance Tuning
Use project early to limit columns.
Filter early (where) to reduce row count.
Avoid wildcard searches (contains → has / startswith)
Index-aware queries improve performance.
🧩 Tips, Tricks, and Patterns
Prefer has over contains for word-matching.
Use toscalar() to assign values from a query.
Use distinct for unique rows.
Combine logs with union.
Debug using print.
🎯 Real-life Scenarios and Examples
Find top 5 IPs with failed login attempts:
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != 0
| summarize Count = count() by IPAddress
| top 5 by Count desc
Analyze CPU over time:
Perf
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 10m), Computer
| render timechart

✨ Charm Glimpse of KQL
"Querying logs should be poetic."

KQL is not just a query language; it's an analyst's wand, a developer's magnifier, and a security guardian's shield. Use it to slice time, stitch patterns, sniff anomalies, and trace problems — all with readable, powerful syntax.
